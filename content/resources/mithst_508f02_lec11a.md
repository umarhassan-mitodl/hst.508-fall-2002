  youtube_description: "MIT HST.508 Genomics and Computational Biology, Fall 2002\n\
    Instructor: George Church\nView the complete course: https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/hst-508-genomics-and-computational-biology-fall-2002/\n\
    YouTube Playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUl4u3cNGP61gaHWysmlYNeGsuUI8y5GV\n\
    \nWe'll talk about multicellular models that involve sensory integration and integration\
    \ of higher levels, and then all the way up to multi-organ systems, where we'll\
    \ take an example from the atomic scale, all the way up to organ system failure.\n\
