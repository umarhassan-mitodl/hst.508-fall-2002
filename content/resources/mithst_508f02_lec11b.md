    \nWe just finished our talk of predator, prey, and host parasites impact on ecological\
    \ modeling in oceans and in public health. What are the global and socioeconomic\
    \ considerations? What kind of impact do these kind of models have on how we make\
    \ decisions?\n\nLicense: Creative Commons BY-NC-SA\nMore information at https://ocw.mit.edu/terms\n\
