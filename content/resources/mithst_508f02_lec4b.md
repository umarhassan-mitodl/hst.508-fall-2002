    \nWelcome back to the second half, where we'll talk about multisequence alignment,\
    \ for starters. This leads to the issue of finding genes, a particular type of\
    \ distant sequence comparison. The ones interested in is finding motifs that are\
    \ involved in finding genes. And finally, we'll end on hidden Markov model, the\
    \ simplest one that I could think of that would really illustrate the idea of\
    \ Markov models, probabilistic models, and the hiddenness.\n\nLicense: Creative\
