    Instructor: George Church\nView the complete course: https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/hst-508-genomics-and-computational-biology-fall-2002/\n\

    \nWe've come to the first of a series on RNA and expression analysis. We'll start\
    \ with integration of multi-sequence alignment of motifs with RNA structure, and\
    \ then to how these RNA structures play their role by achieving different levels\
    \ in the cell.\n\nLicense: Creative Commons BY-NC-SA\nMore information at https://ocw.mit.edu/terms\n\
