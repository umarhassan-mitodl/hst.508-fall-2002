  youtube_description: "MIT HST.508 Genomics and Computational Biology, Fall 2002\n\
    Instructor: George Church\nView the complete course: https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/hst-508-genomics-and-computational-biology-fall-2002/\n\
    YouTube Playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUl4u3cNGP61gaHWysmlYNeGsuUI8y5GV\n\
    \nThe lecture begins with a RNA 1 overview about the secondary and tertiary structure\
    \ of RNA, and how one integrates dynamic programming in those algorithms. And\
    \ then we talk about measurements and its affects on certain technical senses.\n\
