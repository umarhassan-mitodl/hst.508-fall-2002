    \nWe'll go from a very accurate sequence to a probably less than accurate speculative\
    \ league and specificity, to actually how we actually do get a 3D structure league\
    \ and specificity, and some of the methods that are shared by the computational\
    \ tools.\n\nLicense: Creative Commons BY-NC-SA\nMore information at https://ocw.mit.edu/terms\n\
