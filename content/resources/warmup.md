description: 'Problem Set 1, part 3: Warm-up Notebook

  This notebook is for beginners that have done the Mathematica tutorial. Most of
  it is no harder than a coloring book  It starts with cell manipulation and formatting,
  and it works its way up to discrete recursive functions that operate on Mathematica
  tables and arrays. Many of us are new to Mathematica so if you discover anything
  useful, please include them in your finished notebook.'
